// Create a simple shop application (JavaScript only)
// You have a R200.00 note which you can spend at the shop, use a variable to capture the total
// and calculate the change by using functions for the calculations.
// There are multiple items that you would like to purchase.
// Each item should be represented with a variable and have a cost.
// Here is the menu
// chips: R20
// coke: R13
// sprite: R12
// stoney: R12
// hot dog: R25
// burger: R50
// fries: R15
// ice cream: R20
// Choose at least 4 items that you would like to purchase. Remember, you only have a R200 note
// and need to calculate the change that you will receive after you have purchased the items.
// Use a function to calculate the result and return the result.
// Use another function to log the result in the console.
// For this challenge you do not need to pass any variables as parameters into the functions, just
// ensure that you use the functions to calculate and display the results and ensure to use the
// correct data types.
// Ensure to follow all best practices that you have practiced up until now.
// For submission, please zip your files and upload it to Google Classroom for grading.
// Good luck and have fun!
